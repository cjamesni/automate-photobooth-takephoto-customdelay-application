# automate-photobooth-takephoto-customdelay-application
 
 
 A simple macOS application which runs a custom Automator workflow and passes a System Events call to launch the Photo Booth application and take photos with custom delay and loop options via Applescript.

Use case example ~ when you need some portrait photos for a new passport but are too short on time, cheap and or lazy to go and get them done professionally ~
